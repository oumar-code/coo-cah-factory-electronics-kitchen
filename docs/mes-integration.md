## 1. MES Overview

The Kitchen Electronics Factory deploys **Siemens Opcenter Execution Discrete** as its MES platform, consistent with the Coo-Cah group-wide decision (ADR-002). The MES connects the ERP business layer to the factory floor — translating production orders into real-time work instructions for 5 distinct product families: refrigerators, microwaves, electric cookers, small domestic appliances, and PCB assemblies.

The kitchen electronics MES implementation has a unique requirement not shared by the personal electronics factory: **R600a gas charging traceability** — each unit of refrigerant charged into a unit must be recorded, the weight verified, the unit leak-tested, and the test result linked to the serial number and MES job card. This drives factory floor safety and NESREA regulatory compliance.

| MES Attribute | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Platform | Siemens Opcenter Execution Discrete (SaaS + Edge Node) |
| Deployment Model | Cloud SaaS (group visibility) + Edge Node (factory autonomous) |
| Production Zones | 10 production zones, 42 MES-connected workstations |
| Serial Traceability | All refrigerators, microwaves, cookers, and SDAs serialised |
| Gas Charging Integration | R600a charging station OPC-UA → MES gas module |
| ERP Integration | REST API bidirectional sync with group ERP (SAP/Oracle/Odoo) |
| Digital Twin Integration | REST API + event streaming to Coo-Cah DT Engine |

## 4. R600a Gas Charging MES Module (Unique to Kitchen Electronics)

This is a safety-critical MES module unique to this factory. It ensures full traceability of every gram of R600a charged into every refrigerator unit.

```
Refrigerator Unit Serial Scanned (at Z5 Entry)
│
▼
MES R600a Module: Check Job Card Gas Spec
  (Nominal charge weight ± tolerance per model)
│
▼
Gas Charging Controller (OPC-UA) sends:
  - Actual charge weight (grams)
  - Refrigerant lot code (cylinder traceability)
  - Charging pressure (bar)
  - Cylinder ID
│
▼
MES R600a Record Written (linked to serial number):
  - Charge weight ✓
  - Lot code ✓
  - Cylinder ID ✓
│
▼
Vacuum / Leak Test Station:
  - Pressure decay test result (pass/fail)
  - Test duration (seconds)
  - Maximum pressure drop (mbar)
│
▼
MES Writes: Leak Test Result to Serial Record
│
▼
If Pass: Unit released to Compressor Performance Test (Z14)
If Fail: Unit held; rework tag printed; rework station allocated
│
▼
Compressor Performance Test (Z14) OPC-UA:
  - Power consumption (watts)
  - Cooling capacity (BTU/h)
  - Noise level (dBa)
  - All results linked to serial number in MES
│
▼
Unit Released to IPQC (Z9) — full trace chain complete
```

**Gas Usage Reporting:** MES gas module generates:

- Daily R600a consumption by model
- Running cylinder inventory (trigger reorder at < 3 cylinders)
- Monthly NESREA gas usage report (auto-generated for compliance)
