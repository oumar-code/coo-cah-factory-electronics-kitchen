## 1. Introduction

The Kitchen Electronics Factory automation roadmap charts the progressive evolution from semi-automated appliance assembly with a live MES foundation to a lights-out-capable facility for small domestic appliances. Automation investments are staged to match growing production volumes and validated with Phase 1 production data before Phase 2 commitments are made.

**Automation Maturity Scale:**

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Manual | All tasks performed by humans; no automation or MES |
| 2 | Semi-Automated | Key machines automated; manual loading/unloading; paper-based tracking |
| 3 | Connected | MES live; all machines communicating; real-time OEE visible |
| 4 | Integrated | AMRs deployed; automated material flow; AI-generated alerts |
| 5 | Predictive | AI predicts failures, quality defects; scheduling optimised by AI |
| 6 | Autonomous | Lights-out operation for select product lines; minimal human intervention |

**Kitchen Electronics Factory Current Level:** 2 (pre-commissioning)
**Target by End of Phase 3:** Level 5
