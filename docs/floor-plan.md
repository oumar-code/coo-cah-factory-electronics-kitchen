## 4. Material Flow

### 4.1 Primary Material Flow — Refrigerators

```
Z1 (RMS) → Z2 (SMT — PCB sub-assy) → Z3 (Sheet Metal Fab) → Z4 (Main Assy Line)
                                                                ↓

                                                                ↓
                                                         Z9 (IPQC) → Z11 (Packaging) → Z12 (FGW)
```

### 4.2 Primary Material Flow — SDAs (Blenders, Kettles, Rice Cookers, Toasters)

```
Z1 (RMS) → Z2 (SMT — PCB sub-assy) → Z8 (SDA Lines A/B/C) → Z9 (IPQC) → Z10 (Final QC) → Z11 (Packaging) → Z12 (FGW)
```

### 4.3 AMR Routing

| AMR ID | Primary Route | Mission Type |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| AMR-01/02 | Z1 → Z4 (component kits for fridge line) | Inbound replenishment |
| AMR-03/04 | Z1 → Z8 (SDA kitting) + Z8 → Z9 (WIP) | Production kitting |
| AMR-05/06 | Z9 → Z11 (IPQC pass → packaging) | WIP to pack |
| AMR-07/08 | Z1 → Z2 (SMT reels + stencils); Z2 → store | SMT replenishment |

| Ventilation | Forced negative pressure; 15 air changes/hour minimum |
| Gas Detectors | 12× fixed electrochemical sensors; alarm at 10% LEL; shutdown at 25% LEL |
| Electrical Equipment | ATEX-certified all equipment in zone; explosion-proof lighting |
| Emergency Shutdown | Big red manual ESD button; auto shutdown of gas charging pump on high alarm |
| Drainage | Sealed floor — no floor drains in zone (gas pooling prevention) |
| Isolation | Positive-pressure air curtain at zone entry; interlocked with ventilation |
| Fire Suppression | CO₂ suppression system in gas cylinder bay |
| PPE Requirements | Anti-static garments; no phones; gas monitor badge mandatory |

### 5.2 SMT Zone ESD Controls (Z2)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|

| Humidity Control | ESD ioniser bars over solder paste printer and P&P machines |
| Personnel PPE | ESD wrist straps at all workstations; ESD footwear required |
| Packaging | ESD bags and pink anti-static foam for all PCB movements |

### 5.3 Overhead Chain Conveyor (Z3–Z4)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Type | Overhead powered chain conveyor (Power & Free) |
| Length | ~60 m total loop |
| Load Capacity | 200 kg per carrier (for fridge cabinet bodies) |
| Speed | Variable 1–5 m/min (PLC-controlled, MES takt-linked) |
| Workstations | 12 stop-stations; doors, seals, compressor, gas charge, test |

---

## 6. Phase 2 Space Provisions

Space has been pre-planned in the Refrigerator Assembly zone (Z4) for:

- 2× FANUC collaborative robot cells (foam injection and door assembly)
- Expanded conveyor loop extension (+12m for robot cells)

Space has been reserved in SDA zone (Z8) for:

- Lights-out capable conveyor conversion (automated loading/unloading in Phase 3)

## 7. Fire & Life Safety

| System | Zones Covered | Type |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Sprinkler System | Z1, Z3, Z11, Z12 | Wet pipe, ESFR for high-piled storage (FGW) |
| FM-200 Gas Suppression | Z2 (SMT), Z16 (IT) | Gaseous — PCB and server protection |
| CO₂ Suppression | Z5 (Gas Zone cyl. bay) | Fixed CO₂ system |
| Heat / Smoke Detectors | All zones | Addressable fire alarm panel (Notifier) |
| Manual Call Points | Every 20m | Break-glass call points on all escape routes |
| Emergency Lighting | All zones | 3-hour battery backup |
| Muster Points | 3 external points | Assembly areas marked on all evacuation maps |
