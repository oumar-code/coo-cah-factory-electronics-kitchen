## 1. Supply Chain Overview

The Kitchen Electronics Factory supply chain is characterised by a mix of high-value imported sub-assemblies (compressors, magnetrons, induction modules), imported PCB components, and domestically sourced materials (steel sheet, packaging, plastics). The strategy targets maximum Nigerian content in packaging and structural materials while importing irreplaceable technology components with 90-day safety stock to buffer the 22–28-day sea freight transit.

| Supply Category | Origin | % of BOM Cost | Lead Time | Key Risk |
|-----------------|--------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Compressors (fridges) | Import — Embraco/Secop (Brazil/Slovakia) | 22% | 10–14 weeks | Long lead time; single-spec |
| Magnetrons (microwaves) | Import — Galanz/LG (China) | 12% | 8–12 weeks | Tech refresh; import duty |
| IGBT Modules (induction cookers) | Import — Infineon (Germany/China) | 8% | 8–10 weeks | Supply allocation |
| SMT Components (ICs, caps, MOSFETs) | Import — China (multi) | 10% | 4–8 weeks | Reel fragmentation |
| Bare PCBs | Import — China/Taiwan | 6% | 4–6 weeks | Board quality; Forex |
| R600a Refrigerant | Import — licensed distributor | 4% | 4–6 weeks | Controlled substance |
| Steel Sheet Metal (fridge cabinets) | **Local — Nigerian steel service centres** | 8% | 1–2 weeks | Steel price volatility |
| PU Foam System (polyol + isocyanate) | Import + Local | 5% | 2–4 weeks | Chemical compatibility |
| Plastic Casings (microwave, SDA) | **Coo-Cah Plastics Factory** | 6% | **1–2 days** | Internal capacity |
| PCB copper-clad laminate (internal) | Import (China) | 3% | 4–6 weeks | Laminate quality |
| Packaging — Cartons, EPS foam | **Local (Lagos printers + moulders)** | 4% | 1–2 weeks | Local quality management |
| Heating Elements (kettle/toaster) | Import + Local | 3% | 3–5 weeks | Local supplier development |
| Motors (blenders) | Import — China | 4% | 6–8 weeks | Motor quality spec matching |
| Tempered Glass (induction tops) | Import — China | 5% | 8–10 weeks | Fragile; careful packaging |

## 2. Import Logistics

### 2.1 Inbound Freight Routes

| Route | Mode | Port of Entry | Transit Time (CIF Lagos) | Cost (per 40ft HQ) |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Compressors (Brazil) | Sea FCL | Apapa Port, Lagos | 18–22 days | ~$4,200–$5,000 |
| Compressors (Slovakia) | Sea FCL | Apapa / Tin Can | 22–28 days | ~$4,500–$5,500 |
| Magnetrons (China) | Sea FCL | Tin Can Island | 22–28 days | ~$3,500–$4,500 |
| SMT Components (China) | Sea LCL | Tin Can Island | 28–35 days | ~$180–$220/CBM |
| PCBs (China/Taiwan) | Sea LCL | Tin Can Island | 24–30 days | ~$180–$220/CBM |
| IGBT modules (urgent) | Air Freight | Lagos MMIA | 3–5 days | ~$7.00–$10.00/kg |
| Tempered glass | Sea FCL | Tin Can Island | 22–28 days | ~$3,500–$4,200 |

> **Standard routing:** Sea FCL via Tin Can Island preferred over Apapa (shorter dwell time, better container handling). Air freight reserved for urgent replenishment of high-value, low-weight components.

### 2.2 Nigeria Customs Process

| 3 | NCS Pre-Arrival Assessment Report (PAAR) | 5 days before arrival | Licensed customs agent |
| 4 | NAFDAC notification (R600a, polyol chemical) | 4–6 weeks pre-shipment | Regulatory Affairs |
| 5 | Terminal gate release + NCS examination | 2–5 days post-arrival | Customs agent |
| 6 | Duty payment (e-customs) | Same day | Finance |
| 7 | Cargo release + bonded haulage to factory | 1–2 days | Logistics coordinator |
| 8 | Incoming QC + MES goods receipt scan | Same day as delivery | Stores + QC team |

**Applicable Duties:**
